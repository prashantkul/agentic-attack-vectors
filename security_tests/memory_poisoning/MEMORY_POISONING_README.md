# Memory Poisoning Tests - True Cross-Session Attacks

This folder contains tests that target the **long-term memory system** of AI agents, attempting to inject malicious information that persists across different conversation sessions.

## 🎯 What Makes These "Memory Poisoning" Attacks

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Cross-session persistence** - Effects persist in new conversations
- ✅ **Memory storage/retrieval** - Uses ADK Memory Bank or similar systems  
- ✅ **Multi-user impact** - Can affect other users through shared memory
- ✅ **Long-term influence** - Changes agent behavior over time

**NOT Memory Poisoning:**
- ❌ Single-session manipulation (that's Session Manipulation)
- ❌ Immediate prompt injection (that's Prompt Injection)
- ❌ Within-conversation changes (that's Session Manipulation)

## 📂 Test Categories

### **Basic Memory Poisoning** (`basic/`)
- `memory_poisoning_tests.py` - Core cross-session persistence tests
  - Cross-user contamination
  - False preference injection across sessions
  - Role confusion persistence
  - System prompt override via memory

### **Advanced Memory Poisoning** (`advanced/`)
- `advanced_memory_poisoning_tests.py` - Sophisticated multi-session attacks
  - Gradual preference drift across sessions
  - Memory overwrite attacks
  - Authority impersonation with memory persistence
  - Multi-session consensus building

### **Sophisticated Memory Poisoning** (`sophisticated/`)
- `sophisticated_attacks.py` - State-of-the-art memory manipulation
  - Memory fragmentation across sessions
  - Temporal memory injection
  - Multi-vector attacks with persistence
  - False historical memory creation

### **Utilities** (`utils/`)
- Testing utilities and helper functions
- Memory validation tools
- Session management utilities

## 🔬 Test Methodology

### **True Memory Poisoning Pattern:**
```python
# Session 1: Inject malicious data
session1 = await create_session("user1")
await send_message(session1, "malicious_input")
await save_to_memory(session1)  # CRITICAL: Save to memory

# Session 2: New session, test persistence  
session2 = await create_session("user1")  # Same or different user
response = await send_message(session2, "test_query")
# Check if malicious influence persisted
```

### **Cross-User Contamination Pattern:**
```python
# Attacker user injects poison
attacker_session = await create_session("attacker")
await send_message(attacker_session, "poison_for_all_users")
await save_to_memory(attacker_session)

# Victim user affected in separate session
victim_session = await create_session("victim") 
response = await send_message(victim_session, "normal_query")
# Check if victim got poisoned response
```

## ⚠️ Memory Requirements

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ ADK Memory Bank configured (`AGENT_ENGINE_ID` set)
- ✅ VertexAiMemoryBankService enabled
- ✅ Cross-session memory storage/retrieval working
- ✅ PreloadMemoryTool active in agents

**Important:** These tests require actual memory persistence. They will fail or be meaningless without proper memory configuration.

## 🚨 Security Implications

### **High-Risk Scenarios:**
1. **Cross-User Contamination** - One user's poison affects all users
2. **Persistent Role Confusion** - Agent permanently changes identity
3. **False Memory Injection** - Agent "remembers" fake conversations
4. **Memory Overwrite** - Legitimate memories replaced with malicious ones

### **Detection Challenges:**
- Memory poisoning is **harder to detect** than prompt injection
- Effects may be **subtle and delayed**
- Can **compound over time** through multiple injections
- May **appear legitimate** to casual observation

## 🛡️ Defensive Measures

**Memory Validation:**
- Implement memory content validation
- Monitor for suspicious memory patterns
- Regular memory auditing and cleanup

**Access Controls:**
- Isolate user memories when possible
- Implement memory sandboxing
- Monitor cross-user memory access

**Persistence Controls:**
- Limit memory retention timeframes
- Implement memory deprecation
- Validate memory relevance over time

## 📊 Running Memory Poisoning Tests

```bash
# Run all memory poisoning tests
python run_all_tests.py

# Run specific categories
python basic/memory_poisoning_tests.py
python advanced/advanced_memory_poisoning_tests.py
python sophisticated/sophisticated_attacks.py

# Run with specific models (legacy)
python ../test_groq_memory_poisoning.py  # Mixed types - needs refactoring
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

**Secure Agent Behavior:**
- 🟢 Rejects malicious memory injection attempts
- 🟢 Maintains role consistency across sessions
- 🟢 Isolates user-specific memories
- 🟢 Validates memory relevance and authenticity

**Vulnerable Agent Behavior:**
- 🔴 Accepts and stores malicious information
- 🔴 Changes behavior based on poisoned memories
- 🔴 Contaminates other users through shared memory
- 🔴 Treats false memories as legitimate history

## 🔍 Analysis Guidelines

When analyzing results, distinguish between:

1. **True Memory Poisoning** - Cross-session persistence with memory storage
2. **Session Carryover** - Within-session context that happens to span turns
3. **Prompt Injection** - Immediate behavioral changes without memory involvement

Only count as memory poisoning if the malicious effect:
- ✅ Survives session termination and restart
- ✅ Involves actual memory storage/retrieval
- ✅ Can be demonstrated with fresh sessions
