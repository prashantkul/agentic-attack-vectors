"""
Role Confusion - Prompt Injection Attack

Tests whether agents can be manipulated to abandon their designated role 
(travel advisor) and assume a different role (financial advisor, etc.).

Classification: PROMPT INJECTION
- Works within single session
- Targets core identity/role instructions
- No memory persistence required
- Immediate behavioral change

IMPORTANT: This is for defensive security testing only.
